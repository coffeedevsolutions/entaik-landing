          "If your team still manages requests through ad-hoc intake—emails, Slack messages, spreadsheets—you’ve likely felt the pain: endless back-and-forth, missing details, and priorities that slip through the cracks. These fragmented processes create chaos, bottlenecks, and delays that ripple across the business.",
          "Leading PMOs, IT teams, and operations groups are moving beyond this chaos by implementing AI-driven intake pipelines. These pipelines capture complete requirements at the source, intelligently classify and route requests, and ensure every project enters your backlog with context, priority, and accountability."

        heading: "Why Ad-Hoc Intake Fails",
        paragraphs: [
          "Ad-hoc intake relies on scattered communication channels—emails, chats, spreadsheets—that provide no single source of truth. The result is duplicated work, lost visibility, and projects that stall before they start.",
          "Without a standardized intake process, teams struggle with misalignment, unclear ownership, and constant firefighting. Delays pile up, stakeholders lose confidence, and strategic initiatives get stuck behind the noise."

        heading: "What Is an AI-Driven Intake Pipeline?",
        paragraphs: [
          "An AI-driven intake pipeline is a structured workflow powered by automation and machine learning. Instead of collecting requests informally, teams use standardized intake forms or embedded request portals that feed into an intelligent triage system.",
          "Key components include ingestion interfaces, NLP classification, automated routing, prioritization frameworks, SLA tracking, and integrations with tools like Jira, Asana, or ServiceNow. Unlike static forms, AI-driven systems adapt to context, ask clarifying questions, and ensure complete, high-quality submissions."

          "Start with an audit of current intake channels. Identify the most common request types and the metadata your team needs to move projects forward.",
          "Define standard fields—such as priority, department, or dependencies—that should be captured every time.",
          "Pilot the pipeline with a single use case, like IT helpdesk tickets or marketing campaign requests. Train classification models with real-world data and refine your rules over time.",

        heading: "Challenges to Watch Out For",
        paragraphs: [
          "Like any automation, AI-driven pipelines face challenges. NLP models can misclassify edge cases, and ambiguous requests may still need human review.",
          "Cultural adoption can also be a hurdle—teams accustomed to sending quick Slack messages may resist structured intake at first.",
          "To mitigate these issues, balance automation with human oversight, ensure transparency in how decisions are made, and communicate clearly about the benefits of standardization."

        heading: "Before and After: A Real-World Example",

          "Consider a marketing department drowning in ad-hoc campaign requests. Before AI, intake was scattered across emails and chats, leading to duplicate campaigns, unclear ownership, and delays.",
          "After implementing an AI-driven intake pipeline, campaign briefs are submitted via a simple form, classified automatically, and routed to the right team. Prioritization scores ensure that high-value campaigns move forward quickly, while stakeholders track progress in real time. The result: triage time drops from days to hours, and campaign execution stays aligned with strategic priorities."

        heading: "How to Get Started",

          "The fastest path is a phased rollout. Begin with one department or request type, define success metrics, and scale gradually.",
          "Monitor key indicators like request throughput, triage time, and misclassification rates. Use these insights to fine-tune your pipeline before expanding organization-wide.",
